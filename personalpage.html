            Hi. This is my incredibly poorly-designed webpage. There's a reason I do backend stuff mostly.<br>
            I technically have my own webpage that does a lot better than this, but I had Jekyll to work with instead of just raw HTML.<br>
            Perhaps trying to design pages while colorblind is not something I should be doing anyway!<br>
            Anyway, I'm Drew Fink. My birthday's January 1st, and where I'm from is a complicated question, but we'll go with Dallas.<br>
            I grew up coding. The first language I wrote in was PHP... yeah, go ahead and laugh. But I've moved on from that now and my favorite language is now Kotlin.<br>
            Nowadays, I'm studying computer science to hopefully turn programming into a career. It's going well.<br>
            I also grew up cycling, and I'm set to ride over 12,000 miles in 2021! I love everything about it.<br>
            As such, here are my favorite webpages:<br>
            <a>https://stackoverflow.com/</a><br>
            <a>https://strava.com/</a><br>
            <a>https://www.globalcyclingnetwork.com/</a><br>
            And here's one of my favorite songs, from a video game I played a lot as a kid:<br>
